//bie default core java programs will be executed only one thread or single thread
//main thread will be started bythe jvm



//multi thread progaramming (or )concurrency programming language

//what is multi tasking?

/*
Imporatnt concet in 'java'.
1.process based multitasking
2.thread based multi tasking

incase of process based multasking each process addressing the memory in other word each process 
allocating with the separate memory area process based multitasking is heavy weight 
y becoz___switching one process to antother process requires time
each  process will be allocated  with a separate area. 
cost of communication process is high

thread based multitasking or multithreading 
all the threads share the same memory area.
A thread is light weight and process is late
cost of communication is low.


note:- atleast one process required for each thread.

multithreading in java is a process of excuting multithreading simultaniously
